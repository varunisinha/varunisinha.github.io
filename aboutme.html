  <p>
    I am a NYC-based writer, photographer, and multimedia producer. I am trained as a cultural journalist with an expertise in literature and visual studies. 

    I have written tales of a city that never sleeps for Time Out New York. Reviewed the latest games, gadgets, and gizmos for The Toy Insider. Traced the back story of Indian comic superheroes to Manhattan rooftops and Hindu mythology. And sampled the variations of the Sleeping Beauty saga through time for The Post and Courier. 
    
    In short, I love stories: listening to them, telling them, and breaking them down. In the process I have also picked up skills as a coder, graphic designer, and photographer. A Nikon D7200 is my latest purchase. Prime lenses will be next.
    
    When I am not writing, I am usually scratching away at my canvas, painting with my fingers and nails, or tapping into crucial canine time with my first love Leo or his brother Tora.
